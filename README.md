# DevProfileGenerator
PDF Generator for Developer Profiles from Github

This is a command-line application that will connect to Github and generate a PDF form resume of any Gibhub user.

The application requires the input of a Github username and a color-theme input to generate a PDF document, per a form HTML template, using specific data from any Gihub profile such as name, location, # of followers, etc. 

The application then names the PDF by the name of the Github user (i.e. Ada Wan) and saves it to a specified folder.

The user story for this application is extensive, allowing the user to pull specifc data from an external source into their local environment and manipulate that data in a way that is user-friend to their specific busines requirements.
